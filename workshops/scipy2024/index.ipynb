    "We recommend using a preconfigured GitHub Codespace for this tutorial. This section describes how to access and manage a GitHub Codespace.\n",

    "If you prefer to work on your own computer, refer to instructions in the [Getting Started Section](../../overview/get-started.md)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is available to run within [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - \"a development environment that's hosted in the cloud\".\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/xarray-contrib/xarray-tutorial/tree/main?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fscipy2024%2Fdevcontainer.json)\n",
    "\n",
    "☝️ Click the button above to go to options window to launch a Github Codespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub currently gives every user [120 vCPU-hours per month for free](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts), beyond that you must pay. **So be sure to explicitly stop your Codespace when you are done by going to this page (https://github.com/codespaces).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your Codespace is launched, the following happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Interface will open up within your browser.\n",
    "- A built in terminal will open and it will execute `jupyter lab` automatically.\n",
    "- Once you see a url to click within the terminal, simply `cmd + click` the given url.\n",
    "- This will open up another tab in your browser, leading to a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Interface.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning}\n",
    "Consider Codespaces as ephemeral environments. You may lose your connection and any edits you make.\n",
