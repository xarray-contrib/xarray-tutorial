    "# Access Patterns to Remote Data with *fsspec*\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing remote data with xarray usually means working with cloud-optimized formats like Zarr or COGs, the [CMIP6 tutorial](remote-data.ipynb) shows this pattern in detail. These formats were designed to be efficiently accessed over the internet, however in many cases we might need to access data that is not available in such formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore how we can leverage xarray's backends to access remote files. For this we will make use of [`fsspec`](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec), a powerful Python library that abstracts the internal implementation of remote storage systems into a uniform API that can be used by many file-format specific libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with remote data, it may be helpful to understand how xarray handles local files and how xarray backends work. The following diagram shows the different components involved in accessing data either locally or remote using the `h5netcdf` backend which uses a format specific library to access HDF5 files.\n",

For example, when we request the h5netcdf engine, xarray will not attempt to guess the backend. However, it will still check if the URI is remote, which will involve some calls to a context manager. By examining the call stack, we can observe the use of a file handler and a cache, which are crucial for efficiently accessing remote files."

    "## Remote Access and File Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use fsspec to abstract a remote file we are in essence translating byte requests to HTTP range requests over the internet. An HTTP request is a costly I/O operation compared to accessing a local file. Because of this, it's common that libraries that handle over the network data transfers implement a cache to avoid requesting the same data over and over. In the case of fsspec there are different ways to ask the library to handle this **caching and this is one of the most relevant performance considerations** when we work with xarray and remote data.\n",
    "\n",
    "fsspec default cache is called `read-ahead` and as its name suggests it will read ahead of our request a fixed amount of bytes, this is good when we are working with text or tabular data but it's really an anti pattern when we work with scientific data formats. Benchmarks show that any of the caching schemas will perform better than using the default `read-ahead`.\n",
