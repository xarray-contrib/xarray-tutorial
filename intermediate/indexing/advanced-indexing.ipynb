This is the default behavior in NumPy.\n",

    "- *Orthogonal* or *outer* indexing allows for indexing along each dimension independently, treating the indexers as one-dimensional arrays. The principle of outer or orthogonal indexing is that the result mirrors the effect of independently indexing along each dimension with integer or boolean arrays, treating both the indexed and indexing arrays as one-dimensional. This method of indexing is analogous to vector indexing in programming languages like MATLAB, Fortran, and R, where each indexer component independently selects along its corresponding dimension.
