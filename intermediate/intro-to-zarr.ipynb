    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the principles of the Zarr data format\n",
    "- Learn how to read and write Zarr stores using the `zarr-python` library\n",
    "- Explore how to use Zarr stores with `xarray` for data analysis and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a brief introduction to Zarr and how to\n",
    "use it in cloud environments for scalable, chunked, and compressed data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zarr is a data format with implementations in different languages. In this tutorial, we will look at an example of how to use the Zarr format by looking at some features of the `zarr-python` library and how Zarr files can be opened with `xarray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Zarr?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zarr data format is an open, community-maintained format designed for efficient, scalable storage of large N-dimensional arrays. It stores data as compressed and chunked arrays in a format well-suited to parallel processing and cloud-native workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Zarr Data Organization:\n",
    "- **Arrays**: N-dimensional arrays that can be chunked and compressed.\n",
    "- **Groups**: A container for organizing multiple arrays and other groups with a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "- **Metadata**: JSON-like metadata describing the arrays and groups, including information about data types, dimensions, chunking, compression, and user-defined key-value fields. \n",
    "- **Dimensions and Shape**: Arrays can have any number of dimensions, and their shape is defined by the number of elements in each dimension.\n",
    "- **Coordinates & Indexing**: Zarr supports coordinate arrays for each dimension, allowing for efficient indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below from [the Zarr v3 specification](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/ESO/Zarr+Format) showing the structure of a Zarr store:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ZarrSpec](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/terminology-hierarchy.excalidraw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NetCDF and Zarr share similar terminology and functionality, but the key difference is that NetCDF is a single file, while Zarr is a directory-based “store” composed of many chunked files, making it better suited for distributed and cloud-based workflows."
