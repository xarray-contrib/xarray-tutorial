# Keep Exploring!

To help you go deeper, we've also create a list of notebooks that
demonstrate real-world applications of Xarray in a variety of use cases. These
need not be explored in any particular sequence, instead they are meant to
provide a sampling of what Xarray can be used for.

```{seealso}
1. The [Xarray blog](https://xarray.dev/blog) has a number of user stories showcasing Xarray in
many scientific domains.
2. [Project Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/) is a great collection of
material on Xarray and related packages.
```

## Weather and Climate

1. [Global Mean Surface Temperature from CMIP6](https://gallery.pangeo.io/repos/pangeo-gallery/cmip6/):
   Start with `global_mean_surface_temp.ipynb` then feel free to explore the
   rest of the notebooks.
   <!-- 1. [Natural climate variability in the CESM Large Ensemble](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/NCAR/cesm-lens-aws/master?urlpath=lab) -->
1. [National Water Model Streamflow Analysis](https://gallery.pangeo.io/repos/rsignell-usgs/esip-gallery/):
   Start with `02_National_Water_Model.ipynb` then feel free to explore the rest
   of the notebooks.
1. The [Project Pythia Cookbooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org/) are a great collection of
   resources showcasing use of Xarray with real world datasets.
1. [Examples using the Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://github.com/microsoft/PlanetaryComputerExamples)

## Bayesian Statistical Modeling

1. [Xarray and PyMC3](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pymc-devs/pymc3/main?filepath=%2Fdocs%2Fsource%2Fnotebooks):
   Start with `multilevel_modeling.ipynb` then feel free to explore the rest of
   the notebooks. Also checkout [Arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/)
   which uses Xarray as its data model.

## Genomics

1. [From "data analysis for genomic surveillance of African malaria vectors" ](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-5/module-1-xarray.html)

## Electrophysiology
